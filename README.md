**Rick and Morty** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of characters from the Rick and Morty API")**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üòáüòÅüëè**

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] App contains a RecyclerView that displays a list of scrollable data

## Notes
In this project, I added custom fonts to my app, styled the top bar with a unique font,
designed the UI with RecyclerView and ConstraintLayout, customized app theming, and fine-tuned text styles for an attractive user interface.
